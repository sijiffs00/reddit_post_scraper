Anyone interested in deeper networking?,_melfice_,2025-01-25 07:54:30,66,56,"Hey all,

Been here a while and interested in networking more with people either in my position, doing better, or me from a few years ago when I was just starting to get established.

Would be great to have some folks to chat with more on a daily or weekly basis, like a group of ppl in a similar situation. I've had some cool exchanges with people on this sub over the years and really miss that aspect of chatting with others full time like I used to at work. 

* **Moved** *

**Shoot me a dm if you're in one of these groups and want to try and get something started. If not I'll f\*\*\* off and never make a post like this again.**

I've tried this with daytraders or prop/bucket shop traders but it ends up being a lot of noise. The conversations become really annoying/toxic because so much of what they are fluctuate day to day based on their own pnl. They also don't seem to last very long which is its' own kind of depressing.

I don't care about your alpha, there can even be a hard rule to never discuss explicit alpha. There are so many other factors that go into doing this for a living, things like: commiserating rough days/dds, hyping up big days or big updates/milestones to business/process, technical talk(non alpha/IP related), how this stuff affects your life and maybe just some general venting, general market talk and speculation, and potentially do some irl meetups.

**My background:**

I worked in FAANG for a decade and left my career to build trading bots full time. That was 2 years ago and after clumsily learning how to scale and make this a business I now have roughly 1.5m aum. It's been a long road to stabilize things and there are tons more to discuss but I don't want to write a giant diatribe. I am currently working through and just starting to execute my 5 year plan to keep growing and survive the markets long term. 

  
**People I'm interested in chatting with**

**In my position:**

\- Doing this full time for 1-2 years

\- Technical background

\- Still in the process of scaling their business

\- Have a long term plan they're just starting to execute

**Doing better than me:**

\- full time longer than 2 years

\- more established in their business

\- Already have a long term plan that they are currently executing

**Me from 2 years ago:**

\- Built something that's starting to do well

\- In the process of leaving their job/career to pursue this full time

\- Just thinking about their long term plans/goals

Regime focus in Backtesting - How important is it?,JonnyTwoHands79,2025-01-25 04:41:21,9,10,"Hey everyone,

I'm curious what your thoughts are on how much weight you put on testing during different historical market regimes, particularly in regards to determining if a strategy has been overfit to the most recent regime.

My strategy is pretty profitable in the last year (200%+ profitable, profit factor > 2), but it doesn't have a very high Sharpe Ratio (1 range at best), and it definitely breaks down when I start spanning multiple regimes. I also haven't performed Monte Carlo simulations either.

I'm curious:

1. How much consideration should put on Sharpe Ratio, regime testing, Monte Carlo, and walk-forward testing?

I've currently back tested for a 2 year timeframe (last regime) and forward tested for a year with decent profitability, but I'm nervous about the robustness of my strategy when I start looking into these other regimes as performance deteriorates (or goes negative).

Any thoughts or learnings are appreciated!

**Edit**: Thanks for the responses thus far, much appreciated. Adding a little more background for context:  
\- My strategy is a trend-following / momentum based strategy  
\- I've back tested it during each of the regimes above (with separate parameters for each regime) and can find profitability within each regime (and sometimes spanning multiple regimes), but I can't find consistent profitability over the entire 10 year span above using the same parameters.

\- **My thesis (flawed or not) is:** Optimize and continue to improve a single strategy that can be adjusted to any regime (or almost any) and generate very high returns, with the assumption I'll still have to monitor regimes and adjust settings every 6 months or so to maintain profitability. I'm aiming for high returns with the trade off of needing to adjust it intermittently.

\- **One of my biggest questions**: Do successful algo traders have strategies that are truly robust and ""regime agnostic"" that they rarely adjust (set and forget), or do they monitor for regime changes and adjust their settings accordingly?",https://reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1i940z3/regime_focus_in_backtesting_how_important_is_it/,Strategy,1.0

How to Determine the Right Stop-Loss Percentage for Grid Bots?,dadiamma,2025-01-21 00:37:47,15,26,"
I’m transitioning from manual trading to algorithmic trading, so I’m still a beginner in this space. While I’ve been able to create profitable grid bots, I’m struggling with one key aspect: determining the appropriate stop-loss amount or percentage.

In manual trading, I used a strict 1% stop-loss rule, but applying this same approach in a [grid bot](https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/1282566825826) (if someone doesn’t know about grid bots here is the link) strategy has been problematic, especially since the bot executes around 500 trades per day. 

When I use the 1% rule, positions often get stopped out too quickly. I suspect this is due to the unique dynamics of grid trading or the higher invested amounts the bot operates with.

I’m not looking for advice on how to apply a stop-loss but rather how to calculate or decide on the most effective stop-loss percentage for a high-frequency grid bot. 

What factors should I consider? 

Are there frameworks or techniques that can help arrive at a stop-loss amount that balances risk and performance?

Any guidance or insights would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR:

Transitioning from manual trading to algo trading and struggling to determine the right stop-loss % for my grid bot (not how to apply it). My manual 1% stop-loss rule causes frequent stop-outs due to grid bot dynamics (500+ trades/day, higher investment).

Making a fast TA lib for public use,RubenTrades,2025-01-20 11:52:18,23,37,"I'm writing a technical analysis library with emphasis on speedy calculations. Maybe it could help folks out?

All indicators are iterative, so if you get new live prices or new candles, it doesn't need to do the entire calculation again. 

It's built in Rust and compiles to web assembly, so any web-based algos (python, json, js, ts) can calculate without blocking, and without garbage-collection slowdowns.

Is there a need/want for this? Or should it stay a hobby project? What other indicators / pattern detection should I add?

Looking for feedback on algo,Aggressive-Ad-7862,2025-01-20 13:51:28,6,34,"
Hey everyone! I’ve been working on a Python-based algo trading bot for NIFTY long options in the Indian market and would love your input on how I can improve or optimize it. Here’s a quick rundown:


---

What the Bot Does

1. Generates Signals:

I pull real-time data for NIFTY, then run it through a custom “SignalGenerator” that uses indicators like a short EMA cross, MACD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, ATR-based volatility, etc.

I distributed weights almost equally to two each of trend, momentum and volatility indicators. 

It produces a simple directional signal—“CALL,” “PUT,” or “No Trade”—based on whether the combined indicator score crosses a certain threshold. It's written in such a way that at least two indicators need to fire positive. In fact, RSI acts opposite to these indicators if the trend goes into overbought or oversold territory, in which case there has to be a stronger signal from the other indicators to justify taking a position. 




2. Manages Position Sizing:

Right now, I keep it simple by allocating a fixed percentage (like 25%) of my capital for each trade. That way I’m not overexposed, but I’m still putting a sizable chunk of funds to work whenever a signal fires. I'm only experimenting and so I'm okay even if I lose the entire amount I put in. (1 lakh)

I enter into NIFTY ATM long calls or puts based on the signal for which i fetch quote data synchronously and try to undercut the best bid by 10% more of the spread. If the order is not filled, the bot keeps monitoring and modifies the limit price until the order gets filled. Of course i also have logic written for slice orders. Generally in the rare instances it gets partially filled, the next modification almost always fills the order.


The bot also tracks my total daily PnL and will stop trading if I hit a max profit or max loss for the day. Reason i stop after a max profit is to avoid over trading.

I also only enter one position at a time, as it's simpler that way. My broker is Dhan and although they do provide asynchronous data, they only allow quote data for one ticker per second. Which seems too slow to manage multiple positions.



3. Uses a Single Stop Loss & Target Profit:

I used to experiment with dynamic SL/TP that changed based on ADX (trending vs. sideways), but the backtests showed better consistency with just one fixed SL/TP across the board.

So currently, as soon as a buy order is filled, the bot sets a stop loss (say 10% below entry) and a target profit (50% above entry), and just runs with that. I also run with a trailing Stop loss based on ATR volatility once my TP is reached, so that I ride waves, but also lock in profits in case direction reverses.

I know it's a wide SLTP, but I'm only betting on large moves that come once in a while. And based on my back testing with 9 years historical NIFTY minute data, it appears those few times are good enough to recoup the losses and gain decent profits. The signal seemed to have a 30% right prediction for this risk reward of 1:5+, which netted great profits.

This SLTP makes me more of a positional trader than someone who's competing with HFTs which is impossible.

4. Logs Trades to MySQL:

Every partial fill or complete fill gets inserted into a MySQL database. That way, I can review how trades played out—including timestamps, fill prices, rejections/cancellations, etc.

This helps me keep solid records and run my own analytics on the data later.



5. Additional Safeguards:

If the signal says “No Trade,” the bot just waits for the next check—pretty standard.

Once we’re near market close, it attempts to exit any open position and cancels pending orders.

I also have a “kill switch” that triggers if daily losses get too large, so the bot doesn’t spiral out of control if something goes wrong.

6. Backtesting:
I could get my hands on Nifty minute data from 2015-2024. I used it to estimate option prices using Black Scholes, while considering the immediate next Thursday to be expiry date, for simplicity. 

 I also estimated additional entry and exit charges (broker, STT etc.). I also considered 1% slippage, just to keep with realism that I won't always get my prices.

I then created a pytest file that runs the actual main.py, but just emulates datetime and broker calls. This way the actual trading script got tested with the historical data.

What I’d Love Feedback On

Signal Generation: what do you think of my approach? I also have code written for a VWAP indicator which uses The nearest NIFTY futures volume data real-time. But somehow it didn't seem so good at giving signals in practice. 


Also, i tried to create an RL agent for complementing my signal generator that uses technical indicators. But it seemed to be too much effort and I'm just not good enough to build something that works. Instead I though of sticking to the simpler approach. What are your experiences?


Position Management: Right now it’s a simple “25% capital per position” approach. Is there a more adaptive method you’d recommend (e.g., ATR-based sizing, volatility-based sizing)?

Expiry date to trade: I made my code so that I can decide which expiry date to trade in. Since I'm long, would it be better to go one level past the nearest expiry?

Edge Cases: If you see anything missing—like a plan for major volatility spikes or weird partial fill issues—please let me know!

Thanks in Advance!

I really appreciate any thoughts or suggestions. I’m still ironing out the kinks, so the more perspectives, the better. If you’ve done something similar or see any obvious pitfalls, I’d love to hear from you.

The chart above if reddit loads it is the p/l graph of a single automated strategy forward tested over the last 80ish trading days using live non sim data and including fees and slippage. I have been using it live past the dec31 mark and can confirm this chart is accurate.

The strategy (2 con nq) uses a bollinger band squeeze with cci to confirm direction as an entry, then has a take profit at 100 ticks and no set stop loss (however another setup will close the trade). After all of this it compared the direction to another strategy on the daily frame and if they match the trade is taken.

so far it is doing good, maybe too good, but i use it with my account that has 4 times the max drawdown on the chart just to be safe.

the system is automated and uses tradingview webhooks to send orders, i know people here like to bitch and whine about tv but I've had zero problem, plus the response time is like 500 milliseconds at most on a strategy that uses 5 minute candles so yea

I overthing a lot just because I'm not 100% sure it can be possible to make a living out of this,Matusaprod,2025-01-19 01:22:42,87,124,"**EDIT:** Thank's everyone for your kind messages. I'll keep this thread saved and read it again when necessairy.

Hi everyone.

I've been studying trading since 4 years, it was more a side thing up until recently because I have most of my focus on getting a degree. My main goal would be to be an indipendent algorithmic trader as a profession. My two passions are coding and trading, there's nothing I enjoy doing more.

There is just one problem. Due to my accademic studies (quant. finance) I was basically ""brainwashed"" by my professors that would constantly say for 4 years straight that it's not possible to be a profitable retail trader long term, due to efficient markets (which everyone knows there are efficiencies but not exploitable by a simple guy on his room). This coupled witht the fact that everywhere I try to learn something I do some background check on WHO is teaching and all the times: no track records, seems legit guy and then when you go on his website you find one of those sketchy landing pages.

I enjoy trying and coding strategies, I found the simpler ones are those that tend to give better results. But the problem is that I'm not 100% convinced it can be possible to make a living out of this. Sometimes I have these periods where I end up in overthinking because I wonder if I'm just wasting my time and should be doing something else.

I think I just need some ""proof"" that it can be done. So far I found just ONE example: Jerry Parker which was a turtle trader and now running a firm that is active since many years (and it does not seem that they do HFT stuff based on interviews of him).

So I guess my question boils down to: what makes you have 'fatith' on pursuing this thing and believing it can be done consistently over the years? Again, not taling about the type of trading they do at HFT firms like Optiver, Jane Street and so on.",https://reddit.com/r/algotrading/comments/1i4b2l3/i_overthing_a_lot_just_because_im_not_100_sure_it/,Other/Meta,0.88

My TV Indicator that catches Lows with backtest,Professional-Bar4097,2024-12-31 09:33:16,121,70,"Hello, I was told to post my indicator on here so thats what I am doing. The link to it is at the bottom of this post.

It is pretty reliable at catching lows and bottoms as seen in the backtests. I am going to backtest on a lower tf at some point when I have time to.

Here is a copy and paste of my post on tradingview:

Hello everyone, to those who have been trying out my indicator thank you :) 

Everyone was asking for a backtest so I figured out a good strategy for it using only the indicator for entries and exits. It was tested on the ES 1 day (D) chart.

I tested it on something I would actually trade on. I do not know how these exact entry and exit settings and indicator settings would act on other tickers or timeframes.

The leveraged backtest uses the VIX to determine the amount of leverage used.

Commission was accounted for in every trade using IBKR fees. $2.25 per contract per side.

Slippage was not accounted for as I cannot reliably generalize slippage, especially if only 133 trades were taken. Slippage wouldnt likely heavily occur until around 1,000 contracts traded at once. Because of this, the leveraged backtest could in reality return more or less than what it shows as positive slippage could also occur.

In the code shown in the pictures ""(Short Condition)"" does not short anything. I just never changed the default name. It uses a stoploss. Just wanted to write this in case there was any confusion in regards to the ""(Short Condition)"".

In the code, in the position size section, 50 represents 1:1 leverage. 3 represents 16.6:1 leverage. 12.5 represents 4:1 leverage.

Entries: Entries happen when a green arrow is present. It enters the position on the open of the following bar.

Exits: Exits only happen when the current blue line (Pressure Weighted) value is lower than the previous blue line (Pressure Weighted) value. It exits the position on the following bar using a stop loss calculated by the close of the previous bar.

The indicator settings I used can be found on the chart. These usually have to be messed with for different tickers and tfs.

An update will be released to the indicator as soon as this is posted.

Updates include:

A volatility filter setting to filter out arrows during certain volatility.

Vix Weighted Arrows were added. These use the VIX as a weight to add VIX weighted specific arrows in purple. (These were not used in thr backtest)

A Vix Weighted Arrows setting to adjust the weight volatility plays in producing the purple arrows.

This is not new to the update, but every line on the chart is adjustable. This is important because the indicator reacts differently depending on the ticker and timeframe allowing users to easily implement the indicator into there strategy.

The indicator is still free and you can use it here:

We are looking for options for potential providers for historical level 1 and historical level 2 data going back at around 3 years for our specific strategy. Additionally, we are looking to, if possible, stay within a budget of $500/month if possible but we can feasibly stretch ourselves out to $1,000/month if it is worth it. 

After doing a bit of research, it is my understanding that the [Polygon.io](http://Polygon.io) basic package ($30/month) should likely suffice for the simple purposes of testing our model using historical data, which is what we want to do at this point, but Polygon does not yet support historical level 2 data from what I've seen. Our goal is to spend the smallest amount of money necessary to access the minimally viable level 1 & level 2 historical data required for testing. At this point, we are just looking to get things up to running in a testing phase where we are actually able to backtest our strategies before deciding if we want to continue on to a more advanced, more dedicated implementation that has the potential to require more financial and technological resources.
